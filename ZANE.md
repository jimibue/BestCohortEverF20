"I'd rather you show me something small and elegant than something big and unwieldy. Show me you know the design patterns and show me the understanding of the entire frontend flow.

In a junior dev I'd look for:

1. Any use of vanilla JavaScript functions to transform data (I'd first look at your state reducers);

2. What design choices did you make, and why? CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, SASS, TypeScript, do you use proptypes, do you use JSDOC;

3. Do you comment on complex things, and if yes: how? (Tip: Don't say "Loop through the items" if you're describing a for loop that goes through items. Don't tell me what the code is doing, tell me why you're doing it and why you do it in that way. Also: skip on comments when the code is self-explanatory even to a new kid 6 months later.)

4. Did you split things up into sensible components?

5. Are there unit tests? And are you testing the framework, or are you testing your own code? (Please don't test the freaking framework...)

6. What about your chosen CSS solution? Does it show you know what you're doing? Are you animating a box-shadow or are you smarter than that?

7. Does. It. Work.

8. Responsiveness.

9. Documentation (write that README at least).

10. Naming of variables. Is it all useless garbage (vara, varB, var3, varIII, varIV, etc.) or do they actually describe what's in them?

11. Bonus points for setting up your own cloud hosting solution and deployment. Totally cool if you use AWS Amplify to automatically build and deploy your Github main branch to your domain.

12. Bonus points for having an app that's actually doing something useful."
